## What is CodePen? 

CodePen allows you to write a code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build.  
It is also a community, where people can share there code and leave comments on others code.  
A single project on Codepen is called a ‘pen’. :memo:

> *" We're trying to make CodePen a happy and healthy place for front-end designers and developers and the people looking for  them, while also being a damn fine place to code. " :heart:*

2. Searching tags such as “Loader” and “Form” brings up tons of helpful inspiration.

## Why did I choose for CodePen?

* I used CodePen in mmy first year of my bachelor degree and I enjoyed it using it. 
* It's user friendly, it got structure and its not difficult to use. 
* Also is it verry handy that you immediately see what's your code doing or what is it not doing.
