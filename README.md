## What is CodePen? 

CodePen allows you to write code in the browser and see the results of it as you build.  
It's also a community where people can share their code and leave comments on other people's code.  
A single project on Codepen is called a ‘pen’. :memo:

> *" We're trying to make CodePen a happy and healthy place for front-end designers and developers and the people looking for  them, while also being a damn fine place to code. " :heart:*

## Why should you use CodePen?

Pro's | Contra's 
--- | --- 
 **Supports** many languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. |  If you want a private pen/code you need to **pay** and **upgrade** to a Pro account.
 You can **add tags** to your pens, which then become searchable. | The free version of Codepen has **ads** and requires **registration.**
 **Community** has been a huge part of CodePen since the beginning. | **No** way to check **revision history.**

###### Pro's explained:
1. For example u can use HAML, Markdown, Slim, or even Jade for HTML.
2. Searching tags such as “Loader” and “Form” brings up tons of helpful inspiration. 
3. Through comments and sharing, people can give and receive constructive criticism and learn together.

###### Contra's explained:

- [ ]  If u want to make your own private pen u need to pay for a pro version of CodePen otherwise it's always public.
- [ ]  The best tools are not available in the free version of CodePen.
- [ ]  You can't go back in your history to find wich codes you used in your project after you have closed it. You can only undo.

## Why did we choose CodePen?

* One group member has used it before and enjoyed the experience. 
* It's user friendly, it has structure and it's not difficult to use. 
* It's handy that you immediately see what your code is doing or what it is not doing.
